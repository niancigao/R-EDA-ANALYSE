🌷  使用長期股價資料，這份作業的學習重點是： 

+ 使用`lapply()`對集合物件做重複的運算 
+ 使用折線圖檢視時間序列資料
+ 在折線圖中增加更多序列進行比較 

First of all, we `read.csv()` the following data files 
+ `data/IBMStock.csv`
+ `data/GEStock.csv`
+ `data/ProcterGambleStock.csv`
+ `data/CocaColaStock.csv`
+ `data/BoeingStock.csv` 

into data frames `IBM`、`GE`、`PnG`、`CocaCola` and `Boeing` 
and put these data frame in a list object `L`.  

```{r}
L = list(
  IBM = read.csv("data/IBMStock.csv"),
  GE = read.csv("data/GEStock.csv"),
  PnG = read.csv("data/ProcterGambleStock.csv"),
  Coke = read.csv("data/CocaColaStock.csv"),
  Boeing = read.csv("data/BoeingStock.csv"))
```

We say a `list` is a collective object because it accommodate more than one sub-elements. Collectives are also regarded as <z>iteratives</z>, because we can apply some function on each of their elements repeatedly.  For examples ... 

🌻 `lapply(x, fun)` applies fun to each element of `x` and return the results in a list
```{r}
lapply(L, class)
```

🌻 `sapply(x, fun)` do the same thing as `lapply` plus it simplified the resultant object whenever it's possible ...
```{r}
sapply(L, class)
```
Here it returns a named vector which is simpler than a list.   

```{r}
sapply(L, names)
```
In one line of code, we see that there are two columns `Date` and `StockPrice` in each of these data frames  

Besides the build in functions, we can define our own functions,  For an example ... 
```{r}
L = lapply(L, function(df) {
  df$Date =  as.Date(df$Date, format="%m/%d/%y")
  df
  } )
```
We define and apply a function that takes a data frame `df`, converts the `Date` column and returns the data frame. When we apply it to `L`, we accomplish 5 date conversion operations in one shoot. 

You'd find it easier in answering the following questions by `lapply` and `sapply`.

### Section-4 Monthly Trends

__§ 4.1__ For IBM, compare the monthly averages to the overall average stock price. In which months has IBM historically had a higher stock price (on average)? Select all that apply.
```{r}
tapply(IBM$StockPrice,format(IBM$Date,'%m'),mean) #用format把IBM轉成月份再算出各月平均 

mean(IBM$StockPrice)

#1.2.3.4.5月
```

__§ 4.2__ General Electric and Coca-Cola both have their highest average stock price in the same month. Which month is this?
```{r}
tapply(GE$StockPrice,format(GE$Date,'%m'),mean) #用format把GE轉成月份再算出各月平均 
tapply(CO$StockPrice,format(CO$Date,'%m'),mean)

#4月
```

__§ 4.3__ For the months of December and January, every company's average stock is higher in one month and lower in the other. In which month are the stock prices lower?
```{r}
sapply(L,function(df)(tapply(df$StockPrice,format(df$Date,'%m'),mean))) #sapply五支股票1至12月作排列 #sapply(x,fun)對x裡面的每一個子物件執行fun功能並把輸出整理成矩陣 
  
#12月
```

##### ● NINJA's DOJO ●

By combining `tapply` and `sapply`, we can acquire the monthly average stock prices for every stocks  ... 
```{r}
mx = sapply(L, function(df) {
  tapply(df$StockPrice, format(df$Date, "%m"), mean) })
mx
```
❓ Can you see how it works?<br>

🌻 `apple()` applies a function to a two dimensional object in either row or column direction (specified by its second argument, see online help for detail.)    
```{r}
apply(mx, 2, which.max)
```
So we can answer questions `4.1` and `4.2` in one shoot.

To answer `4.3` we need to compare the monthly averages of January and December for the 5 stocks.  We simply use an index that select the 1st and the 12th rows of `mx` ...   
```{r}
mx[c(1,12),]
```

🌷 This is what we mean by **analysis** - organizing data in a way that serves our interest. 

<br><p class="wwl">
<span style="font-size:18px">`r "\U1F4A1"` The `apply` Family：</span><br>
R's major mechanism for iteration is the `apply()` functions ...  
 ■ `tapply(x, category, fun)` applies `fun` to `x` by `category`<br>
 ■ `lapply(x, fun)` applies `fun` to each elements of `x` and returns a list<br>
 ■ `sapply(x, fun)` same as `lapply` but simply the return object whenever possible<br>
 ■ `apply(x, margin, fun)` applies `fun` to every row (column) of `x` when margin is set to 1 (2)<br>
